# Problem

Build a Theme Switcher App using React Context.
 
Requirements:
 
- Create a ThemeContext with two themes: light and dark.
- Wrap the app with ThemeContext.Provider.
- Have a button “Toggle Theme” that switches between light and dark.
- Display some text (e.g., “Hello Students!”) that changes style based on the active theme.
 
- Light → white background, black text.
- Dark → black background, white text.
